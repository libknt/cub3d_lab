# cub3D

## My first RayCaster 

This project was collaboratively created with [Arai](https://github.com/MasaDevs/). I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Arai for their invaluable contributions and support.

### Summary
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever.

### Foreword
Developed by Id Software by the über famous John Carmack and John Romero, published in 1992 by Apogee Software, Wolfenstein 3D is the first true “First Person Shooter” in the history of video games. Wolfenstein 3D is the ancestor of games like Doom (Id Software, 1993), Doom II (Id Software, 1994), Duke Nukem 3D (3D Realm, 1996), and Quake (Id Software, 1996), that are additional eternal milestones in the world of video games.

We recommend that you [test the original game](http://users.atw.hu/wolf3d/).
